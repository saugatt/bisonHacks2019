# Healthy Camp 

We created this app to limit and reduce the spread of infectious disease outbreaks among refugee camp populations. Healthy Camp aims to triage the patient more efficiently based on their health screening to provide the proper care for the patients with infectious diseases and reduce the risk of the spreading of the infectious diseases. The mobile application is a streamlined, user-friendly approach that is customizable according to the refugee camp location. The online web portion allows for data analytics, data collection, and data visualization.
